%\boldmath
  Today, GUI plug-ins development is typically done in a very ad-hoc
  way, where developers dive directly into implementation.  Without
  any prior analysis and design, plug-ins are often flaky, unreliable,
  difficult to maintain and extend with new functionality, and have
  inconsistent user interfaces.  This paper addresses these problems
  by describing a rigorous methodology for analyzing and designing
  plug-ins.  The methodology is grounded in the Extended Business
  Object Notation (EBON) and covers informal analysis and design of
  features, GUI, actions, and scenarios, formal architecture design,
  including behavioral semantics, and validation.  The methodology is
  illustrated via a case study whose focus is an Eclipse environment
  for the RAISE formal method's tool suite.

\section{Analysis and design method}
\label{sec:analys-design-meth}

This section describes a methodology used to analyze and design
plug-ins. The methodology has six stages, each described in a separate
subsection and presented in the order in which they are applied. These
six steps are: \emph{domain modeling}, \emph{user interface},
\emph{events}, \emph{components}, \emph{components communication} and
\emph{code generation}.

\note{What happened to the domain modeling you did? I added in a
  mention of it here. -jrk}

The methodology is illustrated via a case study whose focus is an
Eclipse environment for the RAISE formal method's tool suite.  This
case study is a real project, meant to be used in an academic
environment, and it will be used to illustrate how the methodology is
applied in practice. Due to space restrictions, the entire project's
analysis and design phases are not presented here; instead, only one
scenario of the plug-in is shown from beginning to end.  This way, the
reader sees the evolution step by step, and can then apply the method
themselves.

\subsection{Domain Modeling}
\label{sec:domain-modeling}

\note{To be written.}

\subsection{User interface}
\label{sec:user-interface}

The purpose of the first step is to determine the plug-in
functionality from the user's point of view.  This means identifying
all the things a user can do from the plugin's user interface (UI).
This UI feature set consequently derives the requirements for the
product (the plugin) and designs the UI in the same time.  Therefore,
for each user action that is relevant and important for the plug-in, a
mock-up user interface is created.  Of course, if many user actions
are similar, they can be grouped under a single user interface.  It is
up to the plug-in developer to determine what are the most important
features and how, or if, she wants to prioritize them.

The mock-up user interface can be a vague handmade sketch or a
precise drawing made with an advanced graphical editing program.  The
intention here is not presentation and precision, but instead feature
completeness and UI consistency.

For the Eclipse case study, it was decided, for example, that a user
should have the possibility to typecheck all RAISE Specification
Language (RSL) files (the primary file type of the RAISE tool suite).
Also, the user should have the possibility to translate all files to
SML, to run all test cases existing in all files, and to generate
\LaTeX documents for them.  Therefore, it was decided that these four
actions should be grouped under a menu item which is called \emph{RSL}
and presented in the same UI, for consistency and simplicity.  

\begin{figure}[!t] \centering

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has
% been declared via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions. 
\caption{Eclipse user interface displaying the RSL menu item} 
\label{UIMenu} 
\end{figure}

\note{These figures will have to span both columns to be viewable, I
  suspect. Also note that figure-like things in Latex should always
  appear before their first reference in the source Latex. Also note
  the use of the autoref command. -jrk}

\autoref{UIMenu} illustrates the graphical user interface for the
\emph{RSL} menu item.  This illustration was created by taking a
screenshot of Eclipse and then hand-editing the resulting image in
just a few minutes.

While the user interface is being drawn, product requirements are
documented using EBON \emph{scenario\_chart} elements.  The beautiful
part about using EBON from the beginning is that it allows the
requirements specification to be captured using natural language.
Therefore no intermediate step is required between identifying the
requirements and documenting them.  To demonstrate requirements, this
is how the \emph{scenario\_charts} for the requirements presented in
\autoref{UIMenu} look:
\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:scenario_chart},
caption={Scenario chart for typechecking features.},
captionpos=b]{scenario_example.bon}

% Events
%
\subsection{Events}
\label{sec:events}

\emph{Incoming} events representing user actions and \emph{outgoing}
events meant to inform the user.

% Components
%
\subsection{Components}
\label{sec:components}

Major components captured in BON \emph{static\_diagram}s using
\emph{cluster\_chart} and \emph{class}.

% Components communication
%
\subsection{Components communication}
\label{sec:comp-comm}

Component interfaces added to the interface diagram using
\emph{feature}, \emph{require} and \emph{ensure}. This will later
result in plug-in extensions and extension points.

Update scenarios with events.

% Code generation
%
\subsection{Code generation}
\label{sec:code-generation}

Beetlz generates the Java code from BON specification.
