  Today, GUI plug-ins development is typically done in a very ad-hoc
  way, where developers dive directly into implementation.  Without
  any prior analysis and design, plug-ins are often flaky, unreliable,
  difficult to maintain and extend with new functionality, and have
  inconsistent user interfaces.  This paper addresses these problems
  by describing a rigorous methodology for analyzing and designing
  plug-ins.  The methodology is grounded in the Extended Business
  Object Notation (EBON) and covers informal analysis and design of
  features, GUI, actions, and scenarios, formal architecture design,
  including behavioral semantics, and validation.  The methodology is
  illustrated via a case study whose focus is an Eclipse environment
  for the RAISE formal method's tool suite.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Plug-ins, especially in the realm of plug-ins that wrap existing
research command-line tools, are notoriously badly designed.
Academics simply do not have the resources and expertise to execute on
the design and implementation of a quality plug-in.  Partly this is due
to the fact that there are few examples of best practices in the area,
and partly it is because plug-in development is viewed as the dirtiest
of the dirty-but-necessary jobs of ``selling'' systems technology.

Typically, a researcher has developed a novel tool for Java
programming, lets call it the \texttt{CommandLineWidget}.  They want
others to use this tool, but few people these days want to mess about
with downloading and building source code and, sadly, the barrier to
entry for command-line tools is not insignificant these days.
Instead, the researcher wants to ``sell'' their tool by wrapping it in
the \texttt{CommandLineFeature} for Eclipse, since Eclipse has the
mind-share of most Java developers.  But the researcher does not know
how to think about the UI design of an Eclipse plug-in, design and
program the plug-in, nor is she really interested in learning how to
do these things.

Eclipse plug-in development is a tricky world.  Concepts like
features, plug-ins, extension points, windows, views, \etc abound.
Enormous, poorly documented APIs are prolific in the Eclipse
ecosystem.  To implement even the most basic of features sometimes
takes hours of digging to find the right three lines of code, and then
those lines must change when a new major version of Eclipse comes out.
This is a frustrating world for researchers who want to package their
demonstrable, useful tools for the Eclipse IDE.

This work is an attempt to help resolve these issues.  First, we
provide a \emph{rigorous step-wise methodology through which one can
  do the analysis, architecture design, and user interface (UI) design
  of a plug-in for an arbitrary integrated development environment
  (IDE)}.  Second, we provide \emph{template example plug-ins} that
can be reused by a programmer with a good understanding of Java, but a
poor understanding of Eclipse plug-in development, to develop a new
Eclipse plug-in or feature.

The methodology used is based upon the Business Object Notation (BON),
an analysis and design methodology promoted by Walden and Nerson in
the mid-90s within the Eiffel community~\cite{WaldenNerson95}.
Ostroff, Paige, and Kiniry formalized parts of the BON language and
reasoned about BON
specifications~\cite{LancaricOstroffPaige02,EBON01,PaigeEtal02,PaigeOstroff01b}.
Fairmichael, Kiniry, and Darulova developed the BONc and Beetz tools
for reasoning about BON specifications and their refinement to
JML-annotated Java.\footnote{See \url{http://tinyurl.com/brgcrzc} for
  more information.}  Finally, Kiniry and Fairmichael have extended
BON in a variety of ways to produce Extended BON (EBON), which permits
one to add new domain-specific syntax and semantics to the core BON
language~\cite{Kiniry02-PhDThesis}.

For the reader who has never heard of EBON, think of it as the subset
of UML that might actually have a clear, unambiguous semantics.
EBON's core features are that it is \emph{seamless}, insofar as you
use the same specification language for everything from domain
analysis to formal architecture specification and its behavior,
\emph{reversible} insofar as code generation and reverse engineering
to and from code to EBON is straightforward and tool-supported, and
\emph{contracted} as formal abstract state-based contracts
(invariants, pre, and postconditions) are the fundamental notion used
to specify system behavior.  EBON has both a textual and a graphical
syntax, a formal semantics expressed in higher-order logic, a formal
semantics of refinement to and from OO software, and tool support for
reasoning about specifications, expressing specifications textually or
graphically, generating code from models and models from code, and
reasoning about refinement to code.

The methodology is illustrated on a case study that develops an
Eclipse environment for the RAISE formal method~\cite{RMG95} and
specification language (RSL)~\cite{RLG92}. The project is called
\emph{eRAISE} and it is currently under development at DTU.

Originally RAISE was supported by the \emph{eden} tool
suite~\cite{edenReferenceManual} which was successfully applied in a
range of industrial project.  However, as this tool suite was only
available for SUN workstations, a new tool suite
\emph{rsltc}~\cite{rsltcUserGuide,RAISETools2003}, portable for any
platform supporting the C language, was developed between 1998--2008.

The \emph{rsltc} tool suite consists of a type checker and some
extensions to it supporting activities such as pretty printing,
extraction of module dependencies, translation to other languages,
generation of proof obligations, formal verification, and generation
and execution of test cases.  \emph{rsltc} has a command-line
interface that exposes different capabilities selected via switches,
but is also used from Emacs using menus and key-bindings.  \emph{rsltc}
was also successfully applied in several industrial projects.
However, although it is easy to use for the user comfortable with
command-line tools or Emacs, we expect that the creation of a modern
Eclipse-based development environment for \emph{rsltc} would broaden
its appeal to mainstream software engineers and better enable its use
for university-level pedagogy.

\subsection{Related work}
\label{sec:related-work}

There is little published work that focuses on methodologies specific
to plug-in development.  E.g., Lamprecht et al. reflect over some
simplicity principles elicited by many years' experience in plug-in
development~\cite{6229816}, but do not provide a methodology.

We speculate that there is not much published work because plug-in
development because it is not the focus of scientists until recently.
Moreover, it is a fair question whether or not plug-in development is
any different from normal systems development where a GUI is involved.
We believe that plug-in development is different from normal GUI
development as plug-ins must must integrate into the larger framework
of the IDE, deal with non-GUI events, and work in arbitrary
compositions.

% Analysis and design method
% =========================================================
\section{Analysis and Design Method}
\label{sec:analys-design-meth}

The EBON methodology as applied to Eclipse plug-in development has six
stages, each described in a separate subsection and presented in the
order in which they are applied. These six steps are: \emph{domain
  modeling}, \emph{user interface}, \emph{events}, \emph{components},
\emph{components communication} and \emph{code generation}.

The methodology is illustrated on the eRAISE case study.  Due to space
restrictions, the entire project's analysis and design phases are not
presented here; instead, only one scenario of the plug-in is shown
from beginning to end.  A technical report version of this article,
cited later, provides the entire case study.

% Domain Modeling
%
\subsection{Domain Modeling}
\label{sec:domain-modeling}

The first step when analyzing and designing a system is to establish
its domain model. This is done in order to create a common vocabulary
between those involved in the project and to identify the concepts
used in the product development process. This means that the most
important entities and high level classifiers related to the system
domain must be identified, explained and documented from the very
beginning, so they can be unanimously understood and used throughout
the entire product life cycle.

Looking at the case study name and description, the domain model is
constructed by analyzing areas like Eclipse, RAISE and graphical user
interface. The result is a list of terminologies along with
their explanation, essentially describing entities and elements from a
high level point of view. Some examples from the list are notions like
\emph{editor, console, typechecker, translator, Standard ML
(SML) translator, \LaTeX\ generator, SML compiler, RSL
Perspective} and so on. 

When performing domain analysis we try to identify concepts that are
redundant, which concepts relate to others, etc.  Some of these items
can be grouped in a more general notion, while others are big enough
to covers multiple notions.  For example, \emph{SML translator} and
\emph{\LaTeX\ generator} can be grouped under the \emph{translator}
notion, since both are referring to the process of transforming a RSL
specification into another type of specification. Likewise \emph{RSL
  Perspective} can be seen as a notion that comprises all other items
since inside Eclipse all RAISE elements can be grouped under a single
perspective.

\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:system_chart},
caption={System chart describing the eRAISE system.},
captionpos=b]{system_chart_example.bon}

Such notions are captured using the EBON \emph{system\_chart},
\emph{cluster\_chart} and \emph{class\_chart} elements. The notions
that have been identified are documented as classes, which can be
grouped under clusters and all these make up a unique system.
\autoref{example:system_chart} illustrates a caption of the eRAISE
System specified in EBON notation. Please notice how easy it is to
capture notions and their description in EBON by just using natural
language.

The domain model also describes how concepts behave and how their
behavior is constrained.  In EBON, behavior is specified by using two
concepts called \emph{queries} and \emph{commands}, collectively known
as \emph{features}.  Behavioral constraints are specified using an
EBON concept called \emph{contraints}.  A \emph{command} is a service
that a \emph{class} provides that changes the state of the object that
implements the class, while a stateless \emph{query} is a request for
information from a specific object.  Looking at the case study domain
model presented in \autoref{example:system_chart}, \emph{class\_chart
  Console} offers the service of displaying informative messages or
error messages.  Within this class there is also a \emph{constraint}
stating that the console must be cleared before displaying a new
message.

% User Interface
%
\subsection{User Interface}
\label{sec:user-interface}

The purpose of this step is to determine the plug-in functionality
from the user's point of view. This means identifying all the things a
user can do from the plug-in's UI. This UI feature set consequently
derives the requirements for the product (the plug-in) and designs the
UI in the same time. Therefore, for each user action that is relevant
and important for the plug-in, a mock-up user interface is created. If
many user actions are similar, they can be grouped under a single user
interface. It is up to the plug-in developer to determine what are the
most important features and how, or if, she wants to prioritize them.

The mock-up user interface can be a vague handmade sketch or a
precise drawing made with an advanced graphical editing program.  The
intention here is not presentation and precision, but instead feature
completeness and UI consistency.

For the Eclipse case study, it was decided, for example, that a user
should have the possibility to typecheck all RSL files (the primary
file type of the RAISE tool suite). Also, the user should have the
possibility to translate all files to SML, to run all test cases
existing in all files, and to generate \LaTeX\ documents for them.
Therefore, it was decided that these four actions should be grouped
under a menu item which is called \emph{RSL} and presented in the same
UI, for consistency and simplicity.

\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:scenario_chart},
caption={Scenario chart for the RSL menu item.},
captionpos=b]{scenario_example.bon}

\autoref{UIMenu} illustrates the graphical user interface for the
\emph{RSL} menu item. This illustration was created by taking a
screenshot of Eclipse and then hand-editing the resulting image in
just a few minutes. The RSL menu item has been added as part of the
Eclipse IDE menubar and has four submenu items, each with an associated
keyboard shortcut.

While the user interface is being drawn, product requirements are
documented using EBON \emph{scenario\_chart} elements. The beautiful
part about using EBON is that it allows the requirements specification
to be captured using natural language. Therefore no intermediate step
is required between identifying the requirements and documenting them.
For the eRAISE case study, the requirements associated with the user
interface in \autoref{UIMenu} are captured in the
\emph{scenario\_chart} in \autoref{example:scenario_chart}. For each
submenu item there is a \emph{scenario} element defined by a name and a
description. The four scenarios are grouped under a
\emph{scenario\_chart} associated to the Eclipse RSL menu.

% Events
%
\subsection{Events}
\label{sec:events}

In this stage of the method the entire system is seen as a black
box. The focus is on the external actions that make the system react
and on the system's outgoing responses.  Not all of the system's
outgoing events are of interest, but only the ones that are started by
external stimuli.  More formally, within EBON, scenarios are composed
of events, thus there is a refinement relationship between scenarios
and events.

An incoming external event is any action that determines the system to
change its state. For example it can be a user clicking a button or
another system sending a request.  An outgoing internal event is the
response the system sends to an incoming external event. The system
outgoing event for the action of pressing the button could, \eg be the
display of a new window or writing a message to the standard output.

Looking back at the scenario presented in
\autoref{sec:user-interface}, the user has the possibility to type
check all RSL files. This is illustrated in \autoref{UIMenu} by the
presence of a sub-menu item named \emph{Type check all}. Therefore,
the incoming external action in this case is: \emph{the user selects
the Type check all sub-menu item}. And this external event has been
determined just by looking at the scenarios previously identified.
However, there is another user event that triggers the same system
reaction and that is using the shortcuts: \emph{The user presses
Ctrl+Alt+T}.

\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:event_chart_in},
caption={Incoming event chart for typechecking features.},
captionpos=b]{external_event_example.bon}

Once established, the user actions are captured in EBON using
\emph{event\_chart} elements. The \emph{event\_chart} is either
\emph{ingoing} or \emph{outgoing} depending on the type of the events
they capture.  Since the two user incoming events that have just been
identified aims for the same functionality, they are grouped under the
same name (\emph{TYPECHECKALL}) and captured in
\autoref{example:event_chart_in}.  The \emph{involves} part in
\autoref{example:event_chart_in} is explained later in detail, as it
denotes component communication patterns.

\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:event_chart_out},
caption={Outgoing event chart for typechecking features.},
captionpos=b]{internal_event_example.bon}

If an incoming action triggers changes in the system state, the next
task is to decide how the system should respond to the the action, and
about the changes that have taken place.  For the eRAISE case study,
it was decided that, after the user selects the \emph{Type check all}
sub-menu item, a message should be displayed on the standard output.
The message informs the user about how the typechecking evolved and
since the case study GUI is Eclipse based, the standard output is
considered by default the Eclipse \emph{Console view}.  However, in
some cases, the typechecking may not be successful due to errors in
the input files.  In this case it would be nice to know what caused
the problem and where it is found.  The system should present the
necessary information in the Eclipse \emph{Problem} view.  To sum up,
after the user selects the \emph{Type check all} sub-menu item, the
system updates the \emph{Console} and \emph{Problem} views with
appropriate information. \autoref{example:event_chart_out} presents
the two events captured in an outgoing \emph{event\_chart} under the
names of \emph{CONSOLEUPDATE}, respectively \emph{PROBLEMSUPDATE}.

% Components
%
\subsection{Components}
\label{sec:components}

At this stage in the methodology, in contrast with the previous one,
one looks \emph{inside} the system at the components that constitute
its architecture.  Components refer either to concrete elements, like a
\emph{Zoom in button}, or abstract concepts, like \emph{User
  authentication} which covers everything in the system responsible
for authenticating a user.

The place to start identifying the system architecture components is
the domain model presented in \autoref{sec:domain-modeling}. The high
level classifiers captured there must be transformed into concrete
data types in order to bring the system development closer to the
implementation phase. The advantage of using EBON is that it
simplifies the transit between the domain model and architecture
and manages to capture the concrete data types in language
independent fashion. This is done by taking the entities captured in
\emph{system charts}, \emph{cluster charts} and \emph{class charts} and
transfer them in \emph{static diagrams}. An EBON \emph{static\_diagram}
contains multiple \emph{components} which can be \emph{clusters} or
\emph{classes} and which have the same meaning as the ones composing the
\emph{system\_chart} in \autoref{sec:domain-modeling}.

\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:system_architecture},
caption={eRAISE system architecture},
captionpos=b]{system_architecture_example.bon}

Applying this step on the case study, the system chart presented in
\autoref{example:system_chart} becomes the \emph{static\_diagram
SystemArchitecture} from
\autoref{example:system_architecture}.


% Components Communication
%
\subsection{Components Communication}
\label{sec:comp-comm}

This section concern is how components interact with each other and
what interfaces they present to the other components that want to
communicate with them. The starting point is the list of incoming and
their corresponding outgoing actions identified in
\autoref{sec:events}. This helps identifying the components that react
first to an external stimuli and the components responsible for the
outgoing actions. Once the starting and ending point of the data flow
is established, the other interacting components are determined by
evaluating the scenarios in \autoref{sec:user-interface}. 

In EBON notation, the components communication is seen in terms of
\emph{client, supplier} relationship.  The component providing the
interface is a \emph{supplier} and all components using it are
\emph{clients}.

In the eRAISE case study, one incoming event is \emph{TYPECHECKALL}
presented in \autoref{example:event_chart_in} and its corespondent
outgoing events are \emph{CONSOLEUPDATE} and \emph{PROBLEMSUPDATE}
presented in \autoref{example:event_chart_out}.  Thus, the first
component that reacts to user \emph{TYPECHECKALL} action is the
\emph{TypeChecker}. The component responsible for the
\emph{CONSOLEUPDATE} is the \emph{Console} and the one for
\emph{PROBLEMSUPDATE} is \emph{Problems}. The \emph{TypeChecker}
component typechecks the input and directly informs the \emph{Console}
about the status.  Therefore, the \emph{TypeChecker} is aclient of
\emph{Console} and this is expressed in EBON as: \emph{ TypeChecker
  client Console}. The client relations must be added in
the\emph{static\_diagram} after the components declaration.

%\note{Should I make a new BON example comprising client relations? -mvf}

Since \emph{TypeChecker} is directly stimulated by the
\emph{TYPECHECKALL} event and it is a client of \emph{Console} which
generates the outgoing response, it can be said that\emph{
TYPECHECKALL} event involves the \emph{TypeChecker} and the
\emph{Console} components. And this is how the \emph{involves} part in
\autoref{example:event_chart_in} is constructed. The same method is
applied to \emph{PROBLEMSUPDATE} event. This event is triggered if
there are errors displayed in the console. Therefore
\emph{TypeChecker} sends a message to \emph{Console} and if the
message is an error, a third component called \emph{ConsoleToProblems},
that monitors the \emph{Console}, notifies the \emph{Problems}
component. Therefore, the \emph{PROBLEMSUPDATE} event involves the
\emph{TypeChecker, Console, ConsoleToProblems} and \emph{Problems}
components. This is captured in \autoref{example:event_chart_out}.

\lstset{style={bon}}
\lstinputlisting[style=bon, float=tp,label={example:interfaces},
caption={Console component interface},
captionpos=b]{interfaces_example.bon}

Once it was decided what components are interacting, it must be
established how do so.  This means establishing the contracts between
components by identifying the information a client needs and the
messages it sends to its supplier.  EBON supports the formal
specification of typed interfaces in an programming
language-independent fashion.  Classes are parameterized and contain
formally specified \emph{features}.  Each classifier in the domain
model maps to exactly one class within the formal model, and each
feature of each class within the domain model maps to one formally
specified feature in that class's interface.

For example, the \emph{Console} component in the case study has a
feature called \emph{update} which allows the client components to
sent it messages that will further be displayed to the user. Please
refer to the Console command in \autoref{example:system_chart} for
better understanding.  These messages are just strings like
informative messages or errors.  The situation is captured in
\autoref{example:interfaces}, where the typed feature signatures are
found.  When a client calls \emph{update} on the \emph{Console}, it
must send the message to be displayed to the user and the information
that specifies if it is an error message or not. The assertion
\emph{require} is a precondition that makes sure that \emph{channel}
is one of the values 1 or 2, where 1 stands for standard output and 2
for the standard error output.  EBON also supports postconditions
specified using the \emph{ensure} keyword.

All these software contracts will later on, in the implementation
phase, result in formally specified modules and plug-in extensions and
extension points.

% Code Generation
%
\subsection{Code Generation}
\label{sec:code-generation}

Once the analysis and design parts are finished, the next step is to
generate the formally specified code skeleton.  This step is
accomplished using a tool named Beetlz, which automatically generates
JML-annotated Java code from an EBON specification~\cite{Darulova09}.
The input of this tool is the EBON \emph{system\_chart} and
\emph{static\_diagram} that were obtained throughout the entire
analysis and design.  With just one click, Beetlz converts all EBON
specifications into JML-annotated, Javadoc documented Java code.
Beetlz also performs refinement analysis so that architecture drift is
automatically identified as the system evolves, either at the
model-level in EBON, or within the implementation in Java.

For example, \autoref{example:generate-code} shows the
\texttt{Console} class generated by Beetlz for the component with the
same name described in the \emph{static\_diagram} in
\autoref{example:interfaces}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={example:generate-code},
caption={Java Console class generated by Beetlz}]
public /*@ nullable_by_default @*/ class Console  {
   //@ ensures channel == 1 || channel == 2; public void
   update(List<Char> message, Channel channel){}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The full specification of our case study is available in a technical
report version of this paper.  Its appendix contains all of the UI
sketches for the various plug-ins in the eRAISE feature, the high-level
concept/domain analysis, the specification of events, the architecture
specification, the formal component interface design, and the code
generated from that design.  The example plug-ins and feature are also
available in our repository at
GitHub.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kiniry/eRAISE}}

The student responsible for the design and development of this plug-in
(the first author), had to learn and apply this methodology in only a
few short weeks.  That is evidence for its utility.  Only after
completing the plug-in will we be able to reflect upon how well the
analysis and design match the final implementation, but if past
projects using the EBON methodology are any indication, we expect to
see no architectural drift and full feature compliance.\footnote{Note
  to the reviewers: we expect that development will be complete by the
  time of the workshop so that we can demonstrate it in San Francisco.}

There are several opportunities for next steps refining this work in
the context of plug-in development.  

First, we would like to augment our advanced command-line options tool
suite \emph{CLOPS} for plug-in development.  CLOPS permits one to
declaratively specific the syntax and semantics of the command-line
options of a tool.  CLOPS reasons about such specifications (it has a
formal semantics) and generates a lexer, parser, well-formedness
checker, and documentation.  Extending CLOPS to generate a set of
Eclipse plug-ins and architecture documentation, like that we
hand-write in this methodology, would be a valuable exercise and
